# crunchlabs-domino-robot

Code comes from the [Crunchlabs website](https://www.crunchlabs.com/products/domino-robot)

Note that Crunchlabs did not release a license, alongside the programs, so I have not included one, either.

This repo includes

## Base

Follows path you draw and places dominos



## Auto Knock Down

After the dominos are placed, the robot spins around, and knocks the stack over



## Line Racer



## IR Remote

Install the IR receiver from the IR Turret and use it to control the domino robot
